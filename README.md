# Dice-Roller---Dnd-Monster-Maker
NOTE: This is still currently in development but most features work!

  The code includes a dice roller, monster maker, and a "Book" intended for the use of DnD.
  
  Dice Roller - The user is able to make multiple dice rolls at once, with different 
parameters from rolling dice to multiple dice rolls.                                
       - Ex: d10 or 2d4+10                                 
  Monster Maker - The user can make custom "home brew" monsters, with the ability to add stats,
immunities, description, and more

  'Book' - The Book is a reference point that the user can use to look at created monsters later on.

Currently working on:                                                     
Battle Page - A special function that uses the dice roller along with the monsters stat modifiers to 
calculate its attack and/or save rolls.
